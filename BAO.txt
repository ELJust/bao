PREPARATIONS
2 players
each has 16 holes on their side of board.
Each hole is filled with 2 pebbles at the start of the game.

HOW TO PLAY
At each turn, a player empties all pebbles of a hole and moves clockwise, dropping a pebble in each consecutive hole. 
If the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over.
If the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on: 
	- if the hole is part of the outside row, all peppbles are emptied and dropped one after the next into the following holes 
		-> if the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over.
		-> if the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on.
	- if the hole is part of the inside row, AND both of the other player's opposite holes are filled with pebbles
	the player can empty his own plus the two other holes and drop one after the next into the following holes
		-> if the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over.
		-> if the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on.
	- if the hole is part of the inside row and only one or none of the other player's opposite holes is filled with
	pebbles, the player goes on to drop a pebble in each consecutive hole.
		-> if the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over.
		-> if the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on.

PROGRAMMING
player one game board
x(i) for i = 1,...,16

player two game board
y(i) for i = 1,...,16

Start of the game: 
value for each x(i) = 2 and y(i) = 2
and hand(x) = 0 and hand(y) = 0.

Turn:
empty - add value of x(i) to hand(x) and set value of x(i) = 0.
move - while value of hand > 0, move to the neighbouring hole and set value of it +1 and hand -1 
Stop - If new value of x(i) where I last put +1 is = 1. 
(not)Eat - If x(i) where I last put +1 is > = 2: 
		if i = 1,...,8: 
			if y(i) and y(i+8) !=0: 
				add value of y(i) and y(i+8) to x(i) and set y(i) = 0 and y(i+8) = 0. Then, empty.
			else empty
		else i = 9,...,16 , then empty.

STRATEGIES
- pick random hole to start: start with emptying random x(i) != 0.
- take possibility that max pebbles at the end: start with x(i) that max sum of added values of all x(i)'s
- take possibility that min stealable pebbles: ???
- take possibility that min pebbles of the other player in the next move: ???
