# Bao

Bao is an east-african two-player strategic game played on a board with 16 holes for each of the players. 
At the beginning of the game, each hole is filled with two pebbles, so there are 64 pebbles in total on the board.



*HOW TO PLAY*

At each turn, a player empties all pebbles of a hole and moves clockwise, dropping a pebble in each consecutive hole. 
If the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over.

If the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on: 
	
**a)** If that hole is part of the outside row, all peppbles are emptied and dropped one after the next into the following holes. If the last
pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over. If the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on (see a) to c)).

**b)** If that hole is part of the inside row AND both of the other player's opposite holes are filled with pebbles, the player can empty his own plus the two other holes and drop one after the next into the following holes. If the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over. If the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on as described (see a) to c)).

**c)** If the hole is part of the inside row and only one or none of the other player's opposite holes is filled with
	pebbles, the player goes on to drop a pebble in each consecutive hole. If the last pebble is dropped in an empty hole, the turn is over.
		If the last pebble is dropped in a hole where there is a pebble, the turn will go on.
